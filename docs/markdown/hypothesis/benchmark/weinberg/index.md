Module hypothesis.benchmark.weinberg
====================================
This is a simulation of high energy particle collisions $$e^+e^- \to \mu^+ \mu^-.$$
The angular distributions of the particles can be used to measure the Weinberg angle
in the standard model of particle physics. If you get a PhD in particle physics,
you may learn how to calculate these distributions and interpret those equations to
learn that an effective way to infer this parameter is to run your particle accelerator
with a beam energy just above or below half the $Z$ boson mass (i.e. the optimal $\phi$
is just above and below 45 GeV).
